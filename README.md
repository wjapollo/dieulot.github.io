This repo’s content is only the output of my own clunky static site generator for [InstantClick’s website](http://instantclick.io/), and is thus not really interesting.

Though if something on the site isn’t right (confusing instruction, typo, unidiomatic phrasing), or you’ve got an idea for it, feel free to open an issue.
